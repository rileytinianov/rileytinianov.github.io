title: Delta Robot
description:  This delta robot is an in-progress project I've been working on since mid-April. As someone who enjoyed taking robotics classes at UCSB, I decided to make a delta robot demonstration to visualize end-effector kinematics.

## Overview
Delta robots are a type of pick-and-place robot, often used in the food industry or on assembly lines. This delta robot is being made from acrylic, PLA, and parts ordered online. A modified CNC kit and Arduino shield are used to control the motors. The end goal of this solo project is to outfit the end effector with a laser head to engrave pictures or symbols during demos.

## CAD
All parts of the robot were designed and assembled in Solidworks to ensure meshing between components.

## Manufacturing
The robot is made primarily of PLA and acrylic, which were 3D-printed and laser cut respectively. All universal joints hinge on wooden dowel axles, which were sawed and lathed to ensure proper fit. The metal components were ordered directly from McMaster Carr. GD&T specifications were followed to ensure proper hole sizes and interference fits.
