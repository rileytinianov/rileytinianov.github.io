title: Remote Submersible
description:  This project was made for my junior design class, where we were given a budget of $150 and 6 weeks to make something useful. I designed all things mechatronic, including motor/servo integration, circuit design, and the Arduino programming.
skills: 
- PCB Manufacturing
- 3D Printing
- Rapid Prototyping
- Arduino
- Laser Cutting

## Overview
The submersible was designed with the intention of picking up and removing golf balls from lakes. It was equipped with two large syringes to control bouyancy, two PMDC motors with propellors, and a waterproof 180 degree servo. Weights were stuffed inside to account for the air stored within. Due to budget constraints, the project was primarily made out of spare parts and laser cut acrylic.

### Header 3 
Use this to have subsection if needed
  

### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="project2.jpg" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
{% include youtube-video.html id="tGCdLEQzde0" autoplay = "false" width= "900px" %}

end
```

```python
def start()
  print("time to start!")
```

```javascript
let x = 1;
if (x === 1) {
  let x = 2;
  console.log(x);
}
console.log(x);

```

## Adding block quote
> A blockquote would look great if you need to highlight something


## Adding table 

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
