title: Remote Submersible
description:  This project was made for my junior design class, where we were given a budget of $150 and 6 weeks to make something useful. I designed all things mechatronic, including motor/servo integration, circuit design, and the Arduino programming.
skills: 
- PCB Manufacturing
- 3D Printing
- Rapid Prototyping
- Arduino
- Laser Cutting

## Overview
The submersible was designed with the intention of picking up and removing golf balls from lakes. It was equipped with two large syringes to control bouyancy, two PMDC motors with propellors, and a waterproof 180 degree servo. Weights were stuffed inside to account for the air stored within. Due to budget constraints, the project was primarily made out of spare parts and laser cut acrylic.

## Claw
The claw was acrylic cut and modeled after a claw machine game, where a single linear input results in the actuation of all arms at once. This had to be prompted from inside the submersible, so servo wires were routed and sealed inside so the servo rotation could pull the arms together.

## PCB
I designed and manufactured a PCB to mount the propeller motor drivers and interface directly with the Arduino Uno used. Screw terminals were used to connect the PCB to the syringe motor drivers and servo. The system was powered using 8 AA batteries in series. Commands were sent to the Arduino through keyboard presses to control the device and actuate the claw.
