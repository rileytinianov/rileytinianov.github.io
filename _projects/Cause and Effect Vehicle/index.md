## Overview
For my year-long senior Capstone project, I led a team of 4 engineers in designing and manufacturing a safe and accessible device to be used in therapy sessions for children with Cerebral Palsy. The device was able to seat children aged 2-7 and respond to button presses or joystick inputs to move. The device could also be operated by the physical therapist to ensure user safety and tune parameters.
